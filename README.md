# Tips & Suggestions for Remote Video Calls:</br>
# **Video On** </br>
- Turning on your video camera during remote meetings will help in creating a more personable sense of who is speaking during technical conversations remotely. </br>
- This practice also shows a sense of respect to others time & work in the remote world.
- I typically like to join meetings a minute or 2 early for light conversational chat between meeting attendees when my schedule allows me to do so.
- If the meeting group is larger than 2-4 people, then I like to join the room a little earlier. Entering the room 5-10 minutes prior to your originally scheduled meeting time provides you with an opportunity to speak with idle attendees while the rest of the group trickles in to join the call. </br>
- Joining slighly early also allows you to become comfortable on call and work out any technical difficulties that may arise. 
# **Softening Speech** </br>
- Softening your tone & slowing down your speech helps others in remote meetings follow technical explanations.
- Speaking too quickly can leave your audience lost and/or confused/angry.
- This can be the difference in getting your point across properly or details being lost in translation. </br>
# **Repeat Instructions** </br>
- Repeating steps in technical discussions helps to cement the task/question/comment being iterated to others on the call.
- It also helps you learn more about the process/es you are describing.
- Sometimes steps are lost in translation via video chat, this helps bridge that gap slightly. </br>
# **Send Agenda to Team Prior to Call** </br>
- This will ensure that you are all on the same page before meeting about what you would like to accomplish on the call.
 - Sending out a meeting agenda will also give everybody a point of reference to review key items & talking points before calls. </br>
# **Listen Before Speaking** </br>
- Let others fully finish their thoughts and sentences.
- Negative emotion can be sparked by cutting off another video call attendee. </br>
# **Ask the Right Questions** </br>
- If you are having difficulty managing a guest attendee, you may want to calmly ask them questions about the details they were just reviewing in an attempt to get them to repeat their thoughts and rethink their thought process prior to proceeding forwards. </br>
# **Be Respectful of Others Time** </br>
- Keep in mind that others may have very busy & hectic days scheduled, just like you.
- Always ask if it is okay for your meeting to run over slightly if you intend to push the originally suggested timeframe. </br>
# **No Shows** </br>
- Always give no shows 5 minutes after the meeting has started prior to messaging them to see if they will make it to the meeting. Most of the time, the absent attendee will show up or reach out to you within this given timespan and you want to be respectful towards any difficulties that may arise while working remotely.
- If the potential meeting guest does not show up after 5 minutes, leave the meeting and send them a polite message asking to reschedule with a positive connotation and an assumption that they have a good explanation for not showing up on time, as things happen. </br>
# **Technical Difficulties** </br>
- Speak up and make others aware of technical difficulties you may be having as they arise.
- These things happen and everybody should be understanding, there will always be a solution to technical difficulties.
- If you do not make others aware, nobody will know you are having an issue and this may cause the mood of the meeting to shift negatively. </br>
**I hope these tips and suggestions are helpful in your quest to properly managing agile development team calls.** </br>
