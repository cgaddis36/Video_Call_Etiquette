Tips and Suggestions for how to properly manage agile development team calls.
Tips & Suggestions for Remote Video Calls:
Video On
This will help in creating a more personable sense of who is speaking during technical conversations remotely
It also shows a sense of respect to others time & work in the remote world
I usually join meetings a minute or 2 early for light conversational chat between meeting attendees
If the meeting group is larger than 2-4 people then I like to join 5-10 minutes prior to the original meeting times so that people are not waiting on us and have somebody to speak to as others trickle in to join the call.
Speaking Slowly
Slowing your speech helps others in remote meetings follow technical explanations.
Speaking too quickly can leave your audience lost and/or confused/angry.
This can be the difference in getting your point across properly or details being lost in translation
Repeat Instructions
 Repeating steps in technical discussions helps to cement the task/question/comment being iterated to others on the call
It also helps you learn more about the process/es you are describing.
Sometimes steps are lost in translation via video chat, this helps bridge that gap slightly
Send Agenda to Team Prior to Call
This will ensure that you are all on the same page before meeting about what you would like to accomplish on the call
Speaking orders, who will speak when & on what topics
 Will also give everybody a point of reference to review key items & talking points before calls
Listen Before Speaking
Let others fully finish their thoughts and sentences
Negative emotion can be sparked by cutting off another video call attendee
Ask the right Questions
If you are having difficulty managing a guest attendee, you can try calmly ask them questions about the details they were just reviewing in an attempt to get them to repeat their thoughts and rethink their thought process prior to proceeding forwards
Be Respectful of Others Time
Keep in mind that others may have very busy & hectic days scheduled, just like you
Always ask if it is okay for your meeting to run over slightly if you intend to push the originally suggested timeframe
No Shows
Always give no shows 5 minutes after the meeting has started prior to messaging them to see if they will make it to the meeting. Most of the time, the absent attendee will show up or reach out to you within this given timespan and you want to be respectful towards any difficulties that may arise while working remotely.
If the potential meeting guest does not show up after 5-10 minutes, leave the meeting and send them a polite message asking to reschedule with a positive connotation and an assumption that they have a good explanation for not showing up on time, as things happen.
Technical Difficulties
Speak up and make others aware of technical difficulties you may be having as they arise.
These things happen and everybody will be understanding
If you do not make others aware, nobody will know you are having an issue and this may cause the mood of the meeting to shift negatively.
